## Description

A resturant point of sale system used for in house sales. The system is best used to create tickets for the kitchen and for customer checkout. 


AS A USER: When I open the site, I am prompted to login. If I have not created an account, I may click the link to sign up. When I click the link, I will be sent to the signup page. If instead, I have simply forgotten my password, I can click another link to reset my password. If I do I will be sent an email with a reset link once I enter my email in the prompt. 

Once logged in I will be shown the resturant menu. I will have the option to add products to a ticket. When I add products I will be shown the total with tax for the ticket. I can then submit the ticket.

AS AN ADMIN: I will have the option, once logged in, to perform all normal functionality. As well, I will have the option to add a menu item and see all tickets that have been submitted.
